Forward,not permanent,sweet,not lasting,

The perfume and suppliance of a minute;No more.

OPHELIA

No more but so?

LAERTES

Think it no more;

For nature,crescent and bulk,but,as this templewaxes,

The inward service of the mind and soul

Grows wide withal.Perhaps he loves you now,

And now no soilnor cauteldothbesmirch

The virtue of his will;but you must fear,

His greatness weigh ,his will is not his own;
